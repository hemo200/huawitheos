[Huawei][Huawei] metrics exporter for [Prothmeus][prome].  

The export metrics exporters request basic information from the [S series switches][sseries]. At this stage none of the features of this exportes are designed and nothing planned yet. This is a personal project and I have no idea how to do it. However, I am interested in doing it.  
## Features
The following features are planned for the first phase:
- Get device hostname
- Get active interfaces

## Credit
Special thanks goes to the great team behind prometheus. Kudos to you :)  
  
  Also, I would like to thank the devs of [couch-db-protheus-exporter][db] for the inspiration for writing this markdown.
